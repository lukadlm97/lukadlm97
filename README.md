👋 Hi, I’m Luka Radovanovic, a 25-year-old software developer from Serbia 🇷🇸

📖 I’m currently learning .NET, C#, React.js, Typescript, Python, R etc. and am interested in web development and data science.

👨‍💻 I currently work as a Software Developer at a fintech company.

💻 This repository contains projects and code samples related to my studies and professional work. Some notable projects include:

    
    f1_full_stack: Welcome to our Formula 1 app! This full-stack application allows users to explore and learn about various Formula 1 competitions, drivers, races, and news. The app features different user roles, so that each user can access content that is relevant to them.
    f1_web_app: This front-end application is built using the latest technologies, including React, Typescript, Redux, Material-UI, and SCSS. The app is designed to be a comprehensive resource for fans of Formula 1, featuring all the latest news, stats, and information about drivers, teams, and races.
     time-series-analyse: Welcome to our time-series prediction project! In this project, we are exploring the potential of predicting the behavior of time-series data. We are being mentored by a course from Udemy, which is providing us with the knowledge and tools to delve into this fascinating field. As we progress through the course, we will be applying what we learn to real-world time-series data, testing and refining our prediction models along the way. Our ultimate goal is to develop a reliable and accurate system for predicting the future behavior of time-series data.
      yt-videos-downloader: This personal project was created to make it easier for users to download videos and audio from YouTube resources. It demonstrates our ability to work with the YouTube API and to save videos and audio to the local file system. With our app, you can easily download YouTube content by following simple instructions from the console or through a user-friendly desktop app built with WPF. Whether you want to save a single video or an entire playlist, our app makes it quick and easy to get the content you want.

⚽ In my free time, I enjoy watching and analyzing soccer games and Formula 1, as well as walking, reading, and cooking.
